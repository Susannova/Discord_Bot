# Discord Bot

PATCH NOTES:
 V1.0:
- added auto dm
- Activated Auto Delete in #play-requests 
- added version command

TODO:
- 24h purge in #play-requests 
- redo dyno functions in our bot
- auto dm for people that reacted to play-request with anything else then :x:
- automatically switch from play-request to internal-play-request if more than 5 people  react to a play-request
- integrate riot api
- create ?player command

KNOWN BUGS:
- dyno commands work in every channel - maybe its because i am admin => confirmed only works for admins
- dyno auto role doesnt work => create own version
